# Engineering Development Record

## 2024/08/28

1. Complete a simple test of synchronous FIFO and asynchronous FIFO

## 2024/08/31

1. Compare and add corresponding features to xpm_Fifo-sync

## 2024/09/04

1. Complete the testing of FIFO addition function

## 2024/09/24

1. Add SPI_SLAVE Interface

## 2024/10/10

1. Debug SPI_SLAVE and FIFO Interface

## 0.0.1

1. Complete the joint debugging of SPI_Slave and FIFO to achieve data read and write of CH347, but the clock rate is only 15MHz
   
2. Change the synchronous FIFO to a binary counter, which can achieve non-2 power depth and fix the issue of additional signals

## 0.0.2

1. Improve SPI performance, currently SPI clock can reach 30M at 150M system clock
